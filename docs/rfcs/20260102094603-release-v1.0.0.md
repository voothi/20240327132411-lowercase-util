Prepare documentation for v1.0.0.

## Staging

The release version is v1.0.0.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions
- **Clipboard Utility Design**: Following the pattern of focused, single-purpose utilities. The tool is designed to be invoked manually or via automation (like AutoHotkey) to clean up clipboard content.
- **Text Cleaning Logic**:
  - **Case Normalization**: Core functionality is converting text to lowercase.
  - **HTML Removal**: Uses regex to strip tags, ensuring that text copied from rich sources is cleaned for plain-text use.
  - **Newline Handling**: Implements a specific rule to join lines (`\n(?!\s)`) which effectively flattens text while respecting intentional paragraph breaks.
- **Portability**: The choice of PyInstaller for standalone executable generation allows the tool to be used without requiring a Python installation on the target system.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring compatibility with the Kardenwort ecosystem by providing clean, lowercase output for further processing.
- **Versioning**: v1.0.0 marks the first stable release of my request 20260102094603.
